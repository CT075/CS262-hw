## Basic design of a model machine

We have chosen to represent each model machine as a process, with pipe connections between different machines. The class ModelMachine is a wrapper around this basic design.

## Design decisions along the way

Instead of using a dictionary from pid to pipe to store the connections,
we decided to make use of the spec assumption that there are only 3 
machines, and use a list of pipes where the list index corresponds to a 
particular machine.

Instead of using a class for a message, we decided to use a named tuple with two fields.
